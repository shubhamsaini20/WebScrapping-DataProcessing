# **WEB SCRAPING PROJECT - Mining job hunting websites**



4 team members build this Web_Scrapping project for the final submission at ESILV. 

In this Repo,
we have scrapped the data from multiple job-hunting websites i.e. Linkedin, and Indeed. After extracting data from all these websites we analyze the data extracted, such as trying to find the most needed skills in multiple sectors. The repo also contains a link to a CSV file for the data collected for a better understanding of the data you are looking at. 

The repo also includes a PDF version of ppt we have prepared to highlight the insightful findings.
